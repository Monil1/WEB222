  <p>Cricket is played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team. Each team takes turns batting and fielding, with the fielding team trying to get the batting team out and limit their scoring.</p>
  <p>The game starts with a coin toss, and the winning team gets to choose whether they want to bat or field first. The team that bats first tries to score as many runs as possible, while the fielding team tries to get the batting team out by catching the ball or hitting the wickets with the ball. The teams then switch roles, and the second team tries to chase down the score set by the first team.</p>
  <p>There are several ways to score runs in cricket, including hitting the ball and running between the wickets, hitting the ball over the boundary for a six or a four, and receiving penalties like no balls and wides from the bowler.</p>
