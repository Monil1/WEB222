	<h1>About Myself</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my webpage, a website where you can read and share reviews of cricket game!</p>
	<p>My name is Monil Patel. I am currently pursuing my diploma in computer programming at seneca college. I created this website because I'm a big fan of cricket and I wanted to provide a platform for people to share their thoughts and opinions on the latest releases. I believe that cricket is a form of art and can have a significant impact on people's lives.</p>
	

	<p>Thank you for visiting my Webpage! I hope you find it useful and informative.</p>
